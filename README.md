MinneMUDAC is an experiential learning event inviting teams of graduate and undergraduate students to explore real-world data while enhancing and showcasing their skills.

## Project Overview

**Team Name:** MetricMasters

**Objective:** Analyze real, de-identified mentorship data provided by Big Brothers Big Sisters Twin Cities to identify factors that can have positive impact to create long-lasting matches between adult mentors ("Bigs") and youth mentees ("Littles").

**Approach:**
1. **Data Exploration:** Conducted an initial analysis to understand the structure and content of the provided datasets.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Performed necessary preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyse the sentiment of match support call notes and other text fields to draw actionable insights.
4. **Model Development:** Implemented various machine learning models to predict the longevity of matches.
5. **Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using appropriate metrics and validated findings.
6. **Visualization:** Created visualizations to effectively communicate insights and recommendations.

**Outcome:** Our analysis aimed to provide actionable insights to Big Brothers Big Sisters Twin Cities, assisting them in enhancing their mentorship matching process and improving program outcomes.
